Random Portfolio Dataset Generation

This package provides a simplified way to generate random variance-covariance matrix for portfolio optimization problems.

It follows the paper of Hirschberger et al. to generate the random matrix. The rest is shaped for my research needs, but can be modified for any purpose.
